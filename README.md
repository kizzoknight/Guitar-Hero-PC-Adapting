Guide on adapting guitar hero controller for plug and play on PC

This is a guide on how I adapted a Guitar Hero Wii controller to be plug and play on PC.
While I have only used a Wii controller I see no reason why it shouldnt work with other Guitar hero controllers
This guide will include a simpler version using a USB encoder but no whammy bar with the encoder and 
a more complex version using an arduino pro micro and a custom PCB I designed to make it a bit easier and less destructive.
Using the arduino pro micro version will allow you to use the whammy bar.

All designs and code used will be avalible here.
